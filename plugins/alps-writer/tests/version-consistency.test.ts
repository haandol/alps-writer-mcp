//
// The MCP server hardcodes its version in src/index.ts because importing
// ../package.json would escape tsconfig's rootDir: "src". That second literal
// has now drifted twice: once to 0.3.0 (fixed in 2353d14) and again to 0.4.20,
// when a release bumped the manifests but not the server. Both times the server
// advertised a stale version to every MCP client for multiple releases with a
// green test suite. These tests make that drift a build failure.
//
// The reference is the Claude Code plugin manifest, NOT package.json: both
// package.json files are private (never published) and are pinned to 0.0.0 on
// purpose, so the release version lives only in the manifests. `pnpm bump` keeps
// the five real sites in step; this file fails the build if they diverge.
