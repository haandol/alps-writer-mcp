# adr-invariants.sh — one deterministic oracle for the PRD → ADR → code
# one-way dependency invariants. The adr-sync / adr-rollup skills run this
# instead of re-typing path-fragile greps, so the regexes have a single
# source of truth. It prints file:line for every hit and exits non-zero on
# any violation, so a consuming repo can wire it into pre-commit / CI as a
# hard gate. The adr-writer plugin itself never blocks — when a skill calls
# it, the result is advisory (the model decides what to fix).
#
# Requirements: bash and a grep that supports -r, -E, --include, and
# --exclude-dir (GNU grep or BSD/macOS grep). busybox grep lacks
# --exclude-dir; on such minimal images (e.g. Alpine CI) install GNU grep
# before wiring this into a hard gate, or the exclude flags fail.
#
# Whole-tree scans cover only files a human authors, never generated trees
# (dependency installs, build output, build caches, tool caches, coverage). In a
# git repo the scope comes from git, so `.gitignore` decides; outside git it
# falls back to the EXCLUDES basename list. See scan_tree below for both paths
# and why a repo-indexing build cache in particular has to be off the scan.
#
# Usage:
#   adr-invariants.sh [--adr-dir DIR] [--code-only|--prd-only|--rollup-only]
#                     [--removed "<cat>/<NNNN> ..."]
#                     [--renumbered "<cat>/<old>:<cat>/<new> ..."]
#
#   --adr-dir DIR     ADR root (default: docs/adr)
#   --code-only       run only check (a): code → ADR reverse references
#   --prd-only        run only check (b): ADR → PRD reverse references
#   --rollup-only     run only check (c)+(d): stale citations after a rollup
#   --removed LIST    space-separated ADR ids/paths a rollup DELETED, e.g.
#                     "auth/0002 auth/0003" — enables check (c) and, like
#                     --rollup-only, disables (a)/(b) so unrelated tree hits
#                     aren't misattributed to the rollup. Citations of these
#                     repoint to the CONSOLIDATED (survivor) ADR.
#   --renumbered LIST space-separated <old>:<new> pairs a rollup RENUMBERED
#                     (same ADR, new number), e.g. "auth/0004:auth/0002
#                     auth/0005:auth/0003" — enables check (d) and disables
#                     (a)/(b) (as --removed does). Citations of the old id
#                     repoint to that ADR's NEW number (not the consolidated
#                     one). Kept separate from --removed so the two repoint
#                     directions never get confused.
#
# Exit: 0 = clean, 1 = at least one violation found, 2 = usage error.

# ── what the whole-tree checks actually scan ──────────────────────────────
#
# Only **files a human authors** are in scope. Generated trees are not: a build
# cache that indexes the repo (Nx, Turbo) stores the ADR file list verbatim, so
# scanning it reports every ADR path in the repo as a violation and the real
# hits drown in hundreds of noise lines. That is worse than a false negative —
# an oracle whose output nobody reads is an oracle nobody wires into CI. And a
# hit inside generated output is never actionable anyway: the fix belongs in
# whatever source produced it.
#
# In a git repo, `.gitignore` already IS the "generated vs authored" declaration
# the repo's own maintainers wrote, so the scope comes from git rather than from
# a list this script guesses. `--cached --others --exclude-standard` = tracked
# files plus untracked-but-not-ignored ones, which is exactly "authored": a new
# file the user just wrote is still checked before it is staged, while anything
# ignored is skipped without this script needing to know that Nx calls its cache
# `.nx` or that uv calls its venv `.venv`. New tooling gets excluded for free the
# moment the repo ignores it.
#
# The EXCLUDES list below is only the fallback for when git can't answer (no git
# installed, or a plain directory that was never `git init`ed). It covers the
# common generated basenames, and being a basename match it is necessarily
# coarser than `.gitignore` — a real source dir named `build/` or `target/` gets
# pruned. That is acceptable for a fallback, and is the reason the git path is
# preferred whenever it's available.
#
# Both scanning sites (check (a) and the rollup citation scan) go through
# scan_tree so the two can never drift to different scopes.
