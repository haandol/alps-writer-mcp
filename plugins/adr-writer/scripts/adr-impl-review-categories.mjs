// adr-impl-review-categories.mjs — the finding-category vocabulary shared by the
// impl-review validator and the HTML report renderer.
//
// One table, because the same eleven categories were spelled out in three places
// (the validator's allow-list, the renderer's display metadata, and the
// renderer's sort order) with nothing asserting they agreed. Adding a category to
// one and not the others fails quietly in a different way each time: the
// validator rejects a finding the renderer would have drawn, or the sort order
// falls through to the `?? 99` default and the docket silently stops reading
// worst-first. Both are invisible in a green test run.
//
// Each entry carries everything either consumer needs:
//   hue              severity accent (left rule + tag) in the report
//   blurb            one-line explanation shown on the card
//   authority        which side the confrontation resolves toward — drives the
//                    direction indicator AND matches the SKILL routing:
//                      "adr"        ADR is the spec → fix the code
//                      "minimality" smaller diff is authoritative
//                      "code"       code is authoritative on this fact → fix ADR
//                      "contested"  a real decision change → user must rule
//                      "convention" measured against project conventions
//                      "advisory"   decision-neutral, no ADR↔code tension
//   defaultDecision  seeds the ruling radio so the common follow-up is
//                    pre-selected while the user stays in control
//   priority         remediation priority retained for shared routing and
//                    compatibility. The HTML renderer preserves the report
//                    writer's reader-facing order instead of category-sorting
//                    the final narrative.
//
// Dependency-free and side-effect-free: importable from a CLI without running one.
