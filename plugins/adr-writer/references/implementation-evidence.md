# Implementation evidence contract

Use this contract when implementing, refactoring, or reviewing code governed by
an ADR. Project conventions and established sibling style remain the primary
basis; this contract supplies the completion floor when they are silent.

## Language-standard function documentation

Every named function or method created or materially changed in handwritten code
for the target behavior uses the repository's language-native documentation
form: GoDoc, Python docstring, JSDoc/TSDoc, Rustdoc, JavaDoc/KDoc, or the local
equivalent.

The documentation states both:

- why the function is needed;
- how it enforces the contract-relevant state, permission, ordering, failure, or
  fallback behavior.

A name/signature restatement is insufficient. Reuse the ADR's domain and
requirement-contract vocabulary so repository search can find the implementation,
but never cite the ADR itself. Code comments and docstrings contain no ADR number,
path, link, `ADR` source label, or wording such as “the ADR requires.”

Language-standard documentation may exceed three lines when needed to state the
why and how.

## Inline comments and executable explanation

Keep ordinary inline comments to roughly three lines. When a longer block
enumerates behavior, preserve a short explanation of the why and move the what
into tests:

- boundaries and requirement values;
- ordering or state-transition sequences;
- rejected input;
- failure and fallback;
- duplicates, concurrency, partial failure, and restart behavior when relevant.

Do not delete a long comment before its cases are covered. A comment that records
an external constraint, platform quirk, upstream guarantee, or trap that code
cannot express remains valid even when longer.

## Ideal and relevant edge tests

Every implemented ADR behavior has:

- at least one ideal-case automated test;
- every edge case relevant to that contract.

Select edge cases from requirement boundaries, empty or invalid input, forbidden
transitions, failure and fallback, duplicates, reordering, concurrency, partial
failure, and restart behavior. Do not require unrelated categories to fill a
checklist.

Tests read as executable documentation. Name each test as the behavior it proves
and keep unrelated behaviors separate so a failure names the broken rule.

If the repository has no automated path, add the smallest local,
dependency-free path. A new dependency, broad harness, or destructive expansion
requires a scope decision. Never substitute a manual check and claim completion.

## Review classification

- Missing or inadequate language-standard documentation, or a direct ADR
  reference in code, is `Best practice` weighted `now` and prevents `PASS`.
- A missing ideal case, relevant edge case, or execution result is `Test gap` and
  prevents `PASS`.
- A fully tested long inline behavior comment is a decision-neutral `Refactor`
  candidate; shorten it to the why.
- A test name that does not state its behavior, or one test covering unrelated
  behaviors, is a decision-neutral `Refactor` candidate.
- When property, mutation, static, or security tooling already exists, run it
  only against the target invariants. Do not install new tools during review.
