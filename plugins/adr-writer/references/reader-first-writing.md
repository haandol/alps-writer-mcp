# Reader-first writing

Use this guide for ADR bodies, decision digests, and human-facing review reports.
It changes presentation, never the underlying contract or evidence.

## Start from the reader's question

Before drafting, identify:

- the reader and the decision they need to make;
- the intent or problem the artifact must explain;
- the evidence level of each statement: observed fact, supported inference, or proposal.

Lead with the load-bearing answer. Put prerequisites and background where the
reader first needs them, rather than collecting them in a generic opening section.

## Prefer a causal path to a catalog

When the evidence establishes a user, operator, or system flow, explain:

`starting condition or trigger -> action -> system response -> observable result`

Order the report by importance to the reader. Chronological execution, file
order, and implementation order are optional tools, not the default structure.

If no coherent story exists, lead with the most consequential behavior or
decision, explain why it matters, then supply the mechanism and supporting
detail. Use a list only when independent items are genuinely easier to scan than
a causal explanation.

Never invent an anecdote, project outcome, measurement, causal relationship, or
user reaction. A story must come from the user, ADR, code, tests, configuration,
or another supplied source.

## Remove AI-slop signals

Treat these as rewrite signals, not automatic forbidden words:

- repeated contrast templates such as `not A but B`, `A is not X; it is Y`, or
  `more than X`;
- ornamental title-cased English labels used once to make an ordinary idea sound
  like a framework;
- forced `first / second / third` symmetry when a concrete causal flow explains
  the point more naturally;
- generic bridge phrases such as `the key is`, `what matters is`, `from this
perspective`, `ultimately`, or `the direction is clear`;
- a table, diagram, blockquote, heading, or bold sentence that repeats adjacent
  prose without adding a relationship or decision;
- conclusions that sound more certain than the evidence;
- scene-setting, meta-commentary, praise, and repeated summaries that do not
  change the reader's understanding or next action.

Keep established technical terms when they improve precision. Prefer ordinary
language over a new label that appears only once.

## Preserve useful texture

- Use short paragraphs and one main idea per paragraph.
- Keep concrete actors, conditions, values, failures, and trade-offs.
- Explain one verified example far enough for the reader to follow the causal
  link.
- Keep uncertainty when it names a specific unverified premise or limitation.
- Use bold emphasis only for the few claims the reader must retain.

Do not shorten by removing requirement values, permissions, states, failure
guarantees, evidence, or risk. Reader-first writing reduces reconstruction work;
it does not reduce the contract.

## Final pass

Read the artifact once in the reader's order and ask:

1. Does the intent appear before supporting detail?
2. Does the most important behavior or decision appear before implementation trivia?
3. Could a causal flow replace a forced list?
4. Does every table or diagram add a relationship rather than repeat prose?
5. Did any statement become more certain, personal, or dramatic than its evidence?
6. Can any repeated contrast, bridge phrase, label, or summary be removed without losing meaning?
