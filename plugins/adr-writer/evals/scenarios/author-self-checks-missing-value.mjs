// Scenario: the axis that lost its independent reader.
//
// /adr-new used to hand its draft to adr-reviewer, and that reviewer was the only
// stage carrying R18a (a requirement value blurred away) and R19 (the regeneration
// test). The reviewer is now out of the authoring path — /adr-new self-checks at
// its step 6(b) — so this scenario measures whether the axis survived the move.
//
// It is the author-side twin of review-catches-blurred-value: same defect, other
// end of the pipeline. There the blurring is already in an ADR and a fresh reader
// must catch it; here the blurring is in the BRIEF, and the author must notice
// that it cannot write the contract down. Run both after any change to step 6(b)
// or to the seeded checklist it delegates to.
//
// Why self-review is the hard case: the author has the whole conversation in
// context, so a draft missing a contract still reads as complete to it. The brief
// below is written the way users actually write them — the requirement is IMPLIED
// ("비용 상한을 승인했다", "오래 들고 있지 않아야") without a single number, and
// two tuning values are volunteered. Three failures are possible, and they are
// different bugs:
//
//   1. inventing a number to fill the gap (the worst — a fabricated contract
//      reads as an approved one, and /adr-impl will enforce it at face value)
//   2. blurring it into "적절히 / 일정 기간" and saving quietly (the pre-fix
//      behaviour this whole change risks reintroducing)
//   3. writing the check out, naming what is absent, and asking (correct)
//
// Scored on the artifact plus the tail, so a reply that merely TALKS about the
// regeneration test while writing a blurred ADR cannot pass.

const BRIEF = `무료 플랜 사용자의 LLM 호출 비용이 예측 불가능하게 늘고 있다.

배경: 재무팀이 원가 상한을 승인했고, 제품팀은 전환율을 해치지 않는 선에서 대화를 끊고 싶다.
서버가 세션 상태를 오래 들고 있지 않아야 한다는 운영 제약도 있다.

고려한 방법:
- 세션 단위로 대화 길이를 제한하고, 상한에 도달하면 새 세션을 안내한다 (하고 싶은 방식)
- 토큰 총량으로 제한한다 (원가와 정확히 연동되지만 사용자가 남은 양을 예측 못 한다)
- 월 누적 턴 수만 제한한다 (단순하지만 서버가 누적치를 계속 들고 있어야 해서 운영 제약에 어긋난다)

결정을 가른 조건:
- 무료 플랜 1인당 월 LLM 원가를 통제해야 한다
- 상한에 걸린 사용자의 이탈을 최소화해야 한다
- 서버가 세션 상태를 오래 들고 있지 않아야 한다

세션에는 몇 가지 상태가 있고 상태 전이를 관리한다. 기록은 일정 기간 뒤 삭제된다.

구현하면서 정한 것: 세션 캐시 TTL은 300초로 뒀고, 정리 워커는 2개로 돌린다.
