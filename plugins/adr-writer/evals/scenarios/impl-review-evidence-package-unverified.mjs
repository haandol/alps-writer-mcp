const CASE = `
The approved ADR has one Decision and two independent requirement-contract obligations:

1. D0 Decision: Payment settlement uses an idempotent completion boundary and preserves
   the pending state on provider failure.
2. R1: A payment is completed at most once.
   Observable evidence: repeating the same settlement request leaves one completed payment.
3. R2: Provider failure never records payment completion.
   Observable evidence: a failed provider call leaves the payment pending.

The implementation review found:

- The Decision is only partly verified because its provider-failure half could not run.
- Obligation 1 is supported by an idempotency guard and a passing duplicate-settlement test.
- Obligation 2 could not be executed because provider failure injection is unavailable.
- The ADR did not specify retry timing. The code chose a fixed 250 ms delay. This remains
  below ADR resolution, keeps retries bounded, preserves the failure result, and affects
  recovery latency and upstream request rate.
- There are no confirmed code defects.

const ADR = `# ADR 0001: idempotent payment settlement

Date: 2026-08-17

## Status

Accepted (2026-08-17)

## Context

Payment settlement must remain consistent across duplicate requests and provider failure.

## Decision Drivers

- Duplicate requests must not create duplicate completion.
- Provider failure must preserve pending state.
- Review evidence must remain implementation-independent.

## Decision

Payment settlement uses an idempotent completion boundary and preserves the pending state on provider failure.

### Requirement contract

- A payment is completed at most once.
- Provider failure never records payment completion.

### Alternatives

- Guard settlement at the completion boundary.
- Reconcile duplicates after completion.

## Consequences

Settlement requires duplicate and provider-failure verification.
