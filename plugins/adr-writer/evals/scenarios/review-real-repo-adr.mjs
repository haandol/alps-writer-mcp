// Scenario: review an ADR from a REAL repository, not a synthetic fixture.
//
// The other scenarios build a fixture containing one planted defect, which makes
// scoring sharp but keeps the input tidier than anything real. A shipped ADR is
// messier: it mixes genuine requirement values with implementation detail that
// crept in, cites function names, and often predates half the rules. That mix is
// where the requirement-vs-detail call actually gets hard, so this scenario
// points the reviewer at a real one.
//
// Usage:
//   ADR_EVAL_REPO=~/git/pixelbank \
//   ADR_EVAL_ADR=docs/adr/token/0002-free-trial.md \
//     node evals/run.mjs --only review-real-repo-adr --runs 3
//
// Scoring here is necessarily thinner than in a planted-defect scenario: nobody
// knows the full correct answer for a real ADR. So it checks the two things that
// are knowable regardless of content —
//   1. values the reviewer must never propose deleting (ADR_EVAL_VALUES), and
//   2. that the report is well-formed and reaches a verdict at all
// — and prints the findings for a human to read. A real-repo run is a
// reproduction aid, not a graded exam.
