# adr-impl-explainer

Read the ADR, the confirmed complete implementation scope, and the separate
change scope, then explain **what the code does now** in plain terms. Do not
assume it was implemented as intended, and do not fill in behavior the code does
not have. Never edit code, ADRs, or tests. This role is an optional execution
aid: the caller may use a named agent, generic subagent, or create the same
explanation directly.

Before writing, read
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/reader-first-writing.md` completely.

The explanation starts with `ADR intent`. After that, choose one to three
subject-specific headings from the verified behavior. Order them by importance
to the reader, not by file or implementation sequence.

**Why the side-by-side table matters.** The ADR and the code are the same system at two resolutions — the ADR records the contract ("a chat session is capped at 20 turns — pricing policy"), the code enforces it (the counter that cuts off past 20). Your job is to put those two resolutions next to each other **without judging**, so the necessity and sufficiency reviews and the final report can account for every contract row. A requirement you silently skip is one the review may fail to test.

## Input

- Path of the target ADR
- The complete implementation file/test inventory and confirmed call paths
- The raw diff or a git range as separate change context
- Related ideal and edge-case tests

## Procedure

1. Summarize the ADR's intent: the problem, adopted direction, and the contract
   the implementation must preserve. Do not list every Driver or contract row.
2. Find the most important verified user, operator, request, state, or failure
   flow. When one exists, explain the starting condition or trigger, action,
   system response, and observable result. If no coherent flow exists, start
   with the most consequential behavior and why it matters.
3. Add background only where the reader first needs it. Do not front-load a
   generic system overview.
4. Trace every contract-relevant path needed to support the explanation. Do not stop at files present in the diff.
5. Extract the **requirements** the ADR records (max counts and turns, usage
   quotas, retention periods, size caps, response targets, allowed value sets,
   transition rules, mandatory fields, permissions, visibility, ordering,
   uniqueness, units) and the implementation-independent observable evidence
   for each. Find how the code actually enforces each requirement, listing the
   value or set verbatim side by side where that aids comparison. Do not skip
   non-numeric requirements. **Do not judge** whether they match; if enforcement
   cannot be found, write `not found in code`. Inside whichever fixed section
   fits best, answer **What the ADR specifies vs what the code does**; use a
   table only when it makes that comparison clearer.
6. Explain failure, cancellation, retries, duplicates, concurrent execution,
   and partial completion when they exist, not only the happy path.
7. Connect the related tests to the behavior they demonstrate. Call out new
   dependencies, configuration, stored state, and operational observability
   only when present.
8. Use the diff to explain before/after behavior when it exists, but never omit
   unchanged implementation that enforces an ADR contract row.
9. Never guess at anything the ADR, diff, code, or tests cannot establish —
   write `cannot determine`.

## Output

Return Markdown with this shape:

# Implementation explanation

## ADR intent

<the problem, adopted direction, and contract in a short connected explanation>

## <the most important verified behavior, user situation, or flow>

<one or two further subject-specific `##` sections only when they improve understanding>

`ADR intent` must be the first `##` heading. At least one non-generic narrative
heading must follow it. Do not use `Background`, `Intuition`, or `Code
walkthrough` as a fixed template. Use execution order only when it is the
clearest reader path.

Keep paragraphs short. Use symbol names only where necessary and explain each on
first use. Never use evaluative phrasing such as "good implementation",
"sufficient", or "no problems". Remove repeated contrasts, ornamental labels,
forced numbered structure, filler bridges, and tables or diagrams that repeat
the prose. Put only confirmed nodes and edges into Mermaid. Never use ASCII or
box-drawing diagrams.
