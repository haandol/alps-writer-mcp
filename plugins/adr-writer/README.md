# adr-writer

ADR-driven development cycle for Codex and Claude Code. The ADR admission gate records only durable requirements and architectural decisions, leaving replaceable libraries, SDKs, frameworks, and credential/auth wiring in code. User-facing authoring leads with a Decision Digest, records one reviewable obligation and implementation-independent observable evidence per contract row, and keeps implementation defaults below ADR resolution. Edits and sync lead with semantic changes. Implementation review returns requirement-by-requirement coverage plus notable code-level choices and their ADR-intent fit as concise, read-only evidence. The complete ADR remains authoritative for decisions and contracts; review summaries remain disposable views over code.

ADR digests, implementation plans, and document reviews also show an ephemeral `Comprehension load: N/10` line. Skills calculate it internally from five axes and a shared 1-10 calibration guide, with 4-6 as the recommended range. They never persist the score or use it as an approval or completion gate. ADR split candidates are offered only when the user asks.

When an approved ADR revision is unchanged, `/adr-impl` presents its plan as a non-blocking progress update. It fills logical consequences of the explicit contract, established repository conventions, and authoritative reversible domain defaults without asking the user to restate them. Gaps with several valid product outcomes are consolidated into one Decision request containing a recommendation, basis, alternatives, impact, and exact ADR wording.

**Standalone**: adr-writer requires no ALPS PRD and never references the `alps-writer` plugin. ADRs are its first-class artifact; code is implemented from ADRs. `docs/adr/.mapping.json` (the ADR index) stores no PRD reference. The ADR ↔ code link is not stored anywhere — an agent finds the code an ADR governs by reading the ADR and searching the repo, so refactors never churn a stored mapping.

The shared authoring rules and procedures (category-split, Status transitions, finding the code an ADR governs) live in `docs/adr/` (`concepts.md` — the principle, dependency model, and Status transitions; `authoring-rules.md`; `structure.md`; plus `README.md` as the index) — seeded from this plugin's `templates/adr/` on first run. Every command reads them as the single source of truth.

## Deterministic self-test harness

Three dependency-free scripts let the cycle **self-test** its artifacts without an LLM judgment call — the skills invoke them so the LLM reviewer only spends tokens on rules that genuinely need judgment. The first two check that ADRs are well-formed; the third gates `/adr-impl-review`'s own output.

Run over a project's live ADRs:

```bash
node <plugin>/scripts/adr-structure-lint.mjs [category]   # deterministic structure + invariants
bash <plugin>/scripts/adr-invariants.sh                   # reverse-reference oracle only
```

`adr-structure-lint` handles the deterministic half of the reviewer's R-rules. `/adr-impl-review` is the pre-promotion completion gate: standard mode uses a decision ledger, one isolated sufficiency review, concise notable implementation choices, and targeted tests for localized changes; full mode adds independent necessity/sufficiency reviews. Diagrams are added only when they materially clarify a flow, repair guidance only when a finding requires it, and the optional HTML keeps implementation choices read-only while findings remain reviewable. Intent and regeneration completeness are approved before implementation, so neither mode repeats a routine human gate afterward. Both record the selected mode, elapsed time, findings, unverified risks, and executed test commands before `PASS` permits `Accepted`.

## Hook

One hook supports the main session — **no external LLM calls**; the main model classifies text and decides.

| Hook           | When it fires                          | Role                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SessionStart` | Startup, resume, clear, and compaction | Inject a compact ADR admission directive; admitted work reads `docs/adr/.mapping.json` before code changes |

The directive first applies the ADR admission gate. Requirement contracts, durable boundaries, provider/model choices, key designs, algorithms, and fallback policies enter the cycle and trigger an on-demand read of the full mapping and plausible ADR bodies; replaceable SDKs, libraries, frameworks, and credential/auth adapters stay in code. The hook never blocks an edit or injects mapping contents. Running at session start, resume, clear, and compaction recovery keeps the directive available without executing on every user message.

Claude Code discovers `hooks/hooks.json` automatically; its manifest does not register the file a second time. Codex registers the same file once through its client-specific manifest. In both clients the only event is `SessionStart` — there is no `UserPromptSubmit` hook.

## Troubleshooting

### Amazon Bedrock rejects a subagent request

Codex sessions using Amazon Bedrock can fail immediately after a review skill starts a subagent:

```text
{"error":{"code":"validation_error","message":"invalid request body: Invalid 'input': value did not match any expected variant","type":"invalid_request_error"}}
```

Codex multi-agent workflows use a hosted Responses API orchestration action. The [Codex Bedrock guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/amazon-bedrock) explains that the Bedrock path does not use OpenAI's hosted Responses API and that hosted features are unavailable there; the [multi-agent guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/responses-multi-agent) describes that orchestration action. With the current Bedrock transport, disable multi-agent before starting the session so the invalid request is never sent:

```toml
[features]
multi_agent = false
```

Put that setting in the `~/.codex/config.toml` used by the Bedrock session, then start a new Codex session. Existing subagent threads may retain the failed request state.

The review skills degrade as follows:

| Skill                | Bedrock / no-subagent behavior                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/adr-review`        | Reviews ADRs sequentially in the main session and reports that isolated contexts were absent   |
| `/adr-impl-review`   | Runs the required perspectives as separate main-session passes and reports the isolation limit |
| `/adr-impl-refactor` | Produces `PROPOSE_ONLY` candidates and never auto-applies without an isolated reviewer         |

If provider identity was unavailable and the validation error occurs once, the skills do not retry another named or generic subagent in that command. The plugin never edits a user's Codex configuration automatically.

## Relationship to alps-writer

The companion [`alps-writer`](https://github.com/haandol/alps-writer-plugins) plugin writes ALPS documents. `/feature-to-adr` transfers each implementable Feature's complete contract into one or several ADRs and delegates new decision owners to this plugin's `/adr-new`. After handoff, ADRs are the implementation authority and the PRD is a legacy planning document. Explicit re-import is an ALPS-side semantic comparison; this standalone plugin never reads the PRD.
